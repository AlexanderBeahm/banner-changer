The source code behind `@banner changer #2858`

This bot needs the `Manage Server` permission to work.
Otherwise it can not set the icon or banner.
Right now only those with the `Administrator` permission can use the commands, this might change in the future.
Thanks to all the people behind https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py for such an amazing library!
